This file outlines the steps in which to succesfully install the
django backend and how to fetch from it from your react app

1. install python:
    if you already have python installed you can skip this step if not
    go to this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    make sure that while installing it you click the option to add to PATH
    if your done move to the next step

2. install venv:
    after you have installed python you should open your command prompt and 'cd' into the Meetra directory 
    then you should run this command 'py -m venv venv' and wait NOTE:IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEMS CONSULT ME,
    this should install a virtualenv in the meetra root directory so your file structure should look like:
    Meetra:
        - meetra_backend
        - meetra_frontend
        - venv <= this is what u just installed
        - etc.
    once you have successfully installed your venv move to the next step

3. install django and required modules:
    in this section after you have successfully installed your venv you should run this command in
    your command prompt NOTE: MAKE SURE YOUR IN THE MEETRA ROOT DIRECTORY, 'venv\Scripts\activate'
    notice the backwards slash used. after you have done so you should see a
    '(venv) C:\{ your path }\Meetra>' after this you should run the following command

    'pip install -r requirements.txt' and wait till the process has finished

4. Running the Django development server:
    after you have completed step 3 you should run this command in your terminal
    'cd meetra_backend' => this enters the django folder
    'py manage.py runserver' => this starts the django development server in the link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

5. Making API calls to the django server:
    first of al you should navigate to the link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ to see the django_rest_api links and 
    their general overview. So if you want to make an api call you will reference
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ append the end with whatever link u want to make the call to.
